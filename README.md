# InterpreterSirius
 InterpreterSirius is a software by which the conversion of the high level instructions is performed line-by-line to machine level language. If an error is found on any line, the execution stops till it is corrected. This process of correcting errors is easier as it gives line-by-line error but the program takes more time to execute successfully.
 
⚫ Advantage of InterpreterSirius is that it is executed line by line which helps users to find errors easily.
⚫ Disadvantage of InterpreterSirius is that it takes more time to execute successfully than compiler.
